# C-Exercises

A collection of C programming exercises I've solved.

## Files

- `binary.c`  
  Reads a binary number from standard input and outputs its decimal equivalent.

- `caesar.c`  
  Implements the Caesar cipher encryption technique.  
  Reads an integer `N` (shift key) and a line of plaintext from input, then prints the encoded result by shifting each alphabetic character by `N` positions.

- `hamster_decode.c`  
  Decodes data in the format `[alphabet][indices]`. The program reads input until EOF and reconstructs a message using the alphabet and index list.  

  **Example Input:**
HELOWRD0122343526

  **Decoded Output:**
HELLOWORLD

- `program.c`  
Prints only characters from standard input that match any characters provided as command-line arguments.  
Continues processing until EOF.

- `reverse.c`  
Reads input line by line and prints each line reversed.  
Handles newline characters properly and continues until EOF.
